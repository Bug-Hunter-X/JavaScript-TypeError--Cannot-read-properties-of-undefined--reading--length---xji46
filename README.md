# JavaScript TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error:  a TypeError thrown when attempting to access the 'length' property of an undefined value.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected version.

The error arises because the function `foo` does not handle the case where the input `x` is `undefined`. Attempting to access `x.length` when `x` is `undefined` results in the error.

The solution involves adding a check for `undefined` before accessing `x.length`, preventing the error.

This simple example highlights the importance of robust input validation in JavaScript to prevent unexpected errors and ensure the reliability of your code.
